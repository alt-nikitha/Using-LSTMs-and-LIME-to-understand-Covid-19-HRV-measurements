# Using-LSTMs-and-LIME-to-understand-Covid-19-HRV-measurements

This repository contains work I did for a personal project using wearables data collected by Welltory as part of their COVID-19 and Wearables Open Data Research initiative. Link to their github repo for data : https://github.com/Welltory/hrv-covid19

This is an attempt to classify hrv measurements data taken over a period of 15 time steps into covid and non covid classes using LSTMs. To understand which measurements could be better indicators of Covid-19, I have used LIME to approximately explain which features best explain the changes covid-19 brings about in the body.

This could have large scale implications as wearables that are able to classify heart rate as characteristics of covid-19 could act as early warning systems.
